# Cuda Matrix Multiplication
## About
This is an example of matrix multiplication implemented in cuda with double pointers
## Usage
To use it compile it with nvcc and then run it, to modify the matrices length just modify the mat1 and mat2 
creation code. I still didnt stress test to see if the results are correct with high values.
