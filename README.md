# Cuda Matrix Multiplication
## About
This is an example of matrix multiplication implemented in cuda with double pointers
## Usage
To use it compile it with nvcc and then run it, to modify the matrices length just modify the mat1 and mat2 
creation code. I still didn't stress test to see if the results are correct with big values.
If you (for whatever reason) want to use it in your code just include the header in your code and use the Matrix class
as defined in the header. You can use the helper functions but i don't reccomend it.
